class Calculations:
    """
    A class to perform calculations comparing training functions to ideal functions, including SSD calculation, 
    identifying top ideal functions, calculating deviations, and determining the best matches for test functions.

    Attributes:
        df_train (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing training function data sorted by 'X'.
        df_ideal (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing ideal function data sorted by 'X'.
        df_test (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing test function data.
    
    Methods:
        calculate_criteria1(): Calculates the SSD for each training function against all ideal functions and identifies the top ideal function for each training function.
        
        get_ssd_sums(): Returns the dictionary containing SSD sums for each training function comparison with ideal functions.
        
        get_top_four_ideal_functions(): Returns the list of top four ideal functions with the lowest SSD for each training function.
        
        deviations(): Calculates maximum deviations for each ideal function against training functions and adjusts them by a factor of sqrt(2).
        
        get_adjusted_deviation(): Returns the dictionary containing adjusted maximum deviations for each ideal function.
        
        results(): Determines the best match for each test function based on the deviations and the selected top ideal functions. Stores the results in `test_results`.
        
        get_test_results(): Returns the list of dictionaries containing test results with best matches.
